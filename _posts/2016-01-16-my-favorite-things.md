As I try new things, my tastes change.
That doesn't always mean that I like the thing that I tried.
Maybe I hate it, and solidify my preference for something else.

But my taste in food, literature, movies, operating systems, and tools are always changing slightly.
New things come out, or I find things that I was previously ignorant of.

As such, I'd like to keep some documentation of the tools and ideas that I use.
Maybe it will help others in their quest to refine their own taste.
Hopefully it will help me find new ideas and incorporate them.

Here's my list as of today. It's in no particular order, but I'll try to group like things together.
