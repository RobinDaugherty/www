In January of 2003, the stereo was stolen from my car.
I have been without a sound system since, and I'm getting quite tired of listening to a tiny little radio with poor reception.

After spending hours researching new receivers and even bidding on one or two, I did some research.
I decided to create my own sound system.
I have an MP3 collection, and I will be encoding my CD collection as [Ogg Vorbis](http://www.ogg.org/ogg/vorbis/).

But I also want to be able to listen to the stereo.
After googling for hours, I found the hardware that I have been looking for.
Since I enjoy writing software, I will be integrating all of it myself.

Of course, all of the software I write will be licensed under the GPL, so check back soon for some code.
If you are interested in helping me write or test this get-up, please visit the [Sourceforge Project Page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/music-control/).

## Specifications

- Uses a laptop running Linux hidden away in the vehicle. Mine is a sometimes-working Thinkpad 600.
- For display, an [LCD such as this one](http://www.crystalfontz.com) connected to the laptop through USB. ($75.00)
- For control, a numeric keypad connected to the laptop through USB. ($22.00)
- To be able to listen to the radio, a D-Link DSB-R100 FM Tuner, connected to the laptop through USB. ($34.95)
- My existing two-channel amplifier to connect the factory speakers, and a 1/8&quot; headphone to male RCA adapter to connect it to the laptop. ($7.00)
- My control application uses mpg321/mpg123 and ogg123 to play files. These have a [Remote Mode](http://search.cpan.org/src/MLEHMANN/Audio-Play-MPG123-0.62/mpg123/README.remote) that my application uses.
- Note that vorbis-tools-1.0 must be patched for ogg123 to include Remote Mode. See [this posting on the Vorbis Development List](http://www.xiph.org/archives/vorbis-dev/200210/0008.html). Also, you must have automake-1.4. No other version will work when compiling vorbis-tools.

## Status

## Future Upgrades

- Wireless network adapter, so that I can download music to the player from my home network.
- Manage playlists while the laptop is offline, and upon powerup, have laptop replicate over the wireless network.
- [The Griffin Powermate USB Knob](http://www.eviloverlord.net/powermate.html) as a volume control. Only $39.
