		When I was 10 years old, I was given an old, broken, computer, <a
			href="http://www.thepcmuseum.net/details.php?RECORD_KEY%28museum%29=id&id(museum)=753"
			>some sort of Xerox terminal</a
		> that ran CP/M. I took it apart and put it back together, and when I was done
		it was working again.
	</p>
	<p>Thus began my career in "computers".</p>
	<p>
		I learned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Basic"
			>Borland Turbo Basic</a
		> and began writing simple DOS applications that required the user to enter their
		password. This led me to write a library to do windowing and essentially widgets
		in text mode for DOS. The library included text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons,
		pulldowns, menus, and buttons.
	</p>
	<p>
		Turbo Basic had the ability to include blocks of assembly, so I got a copy
		of <a
			href="http://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-Primer-Personal-Computer/dp/0136619010"
			>Peter Norton's Assembly Language Book</a
		>. My library functions used BIOS calls for keyboard input and screen
		output, which sped things up considerably. I rewrote this library a number
		of times, usually because I made a mistake, lost my backup and had to start
		over.
	</p>
	<p>
		I stumbled across a Microsoft Press book on QuickC (I think it was called
		"Learn QuickC") and ended up rewriting my library using Microsoft QuickC.
		One notable application that I completed in C was a low-level floppy disk
		editor.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1996 I started playing with Linux. I used <a
			href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux From Scratch</a
		> to learn everything I could about how the operating system works. I migrated
		from pure C on DOS, to C++ on Windows and Linux, to PHP.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1997 I began working for <a href="http://www.ovf.com"
			>Ohio Valley Flooring</a
		>, a company that distributes flooring products. At first I supported and
		helped train users, many of whom were long-time salespeople with no computer
		experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		While doing support I began to help with other systems, such as the
		telephone and voicemail system. In my spare time I wrote software for an
		automated attendant, so that customers calling the company would have the
		option of entering an extension instead of going directly to the call
		center. I presented my solution, and management decided to give it a try.
		After it was implemented, the number of calls that went directly to the call
		center were reduced by about a third, while the overall call volume grew
		each month.
	</p>
	<p>
		My responsibilities grew to include telecommunications, and various other
		odd tasks that came about.
	</p>
	<p>
		I worked on many diverse projects, from designing a telecommunications
		network for the company's many locations to helping to troubleshoot the
		software on a programmable logic controller for a flooring cutting machine.
		I designed the data and telephone networking for new offices, gathered bids
		for service, ordered parts, and did the final installation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's <a href="/2008-03-23-one-weird-telecomm-project"
			>one example of a telecommunications-related project</a
		> on which I worked.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2004, I designed a network to link 6 locations together with VPNs to
		connect voice calls and data traffic. I learned to configure Cisco routers
		and Mitel IP telephone systems, how to set up Quality of Service to make
		sure the voice calls wouldn't be affected by data traffic on the same
		connection. I configured and installed the equipment for this network at
		each location, and cut over service one at a time. (This also meant I had to
		design a way to gradually move service to the new network without downtime.)
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2005 I decided to pursue a job doing only software development, and I
		went to work for a company that uses Macs. I became a Mac user permanently
		after using it as my development platform for a few months.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2006 I joined the team running the Motorola Developer Network, a.k.a <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061212132428/http://developer.motorola.com/"
			>MOTODEV</a
		>. I was a senior engineer on the Developer Programs team, responsible for
		the software and hardware that runs the website and related systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2008 I moved back to Cincinnati, Ohio and worked remotely for Motorola.
